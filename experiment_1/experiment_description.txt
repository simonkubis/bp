Experiment #1

1. Keyword extraction

Other patterns mentioned in the text description of a pattern 
are often connected by specific keywords or phrases indicating a relationship between patterns.
"see also", "used with", "used after", "apply before", "related pattern", "requires", "composed of", "alternative to"

The identified keywords can be divided into groups representing the strength or level of their relationship.
1. Negative relationship - patterns should not be used together at all (possible words: "do not use", "never use")
2. Neutral relationship - patterns are not neccesarily advised to be put together neither advised not to (possible words: "see also", "related to", "similar")
3. Positive relationship - patterns are recommended or required to be used together (possible words: "must use", "always use", "together with")

These categories can be further mapped to numeric coefficients 
representing the estimated probability of a reliable joint usage of patterns (possible a range)
never use: 0
could use: 0.5
always use: 1

The final coefficient can then be multiplied by the number of occurrences of the keyword in the text,
producing a simple quantitative score expressing the strength of the relationship between two patterns.

Advantages of this method:
a) Simple to implement
b) Computationally inexpensive
b) Probably would work good on well written texts

Possible problems:
a)
This idea does not take context into account, pattern could be mentioned in one sentence and strongly advised not
to be used together in the next one. We might approach this issue by checking whether the pattern is mentioned again in the previous and following sentence to detect any relevant details.
b) 
This idea lacks understanding the text when synonyms are used, this again, could be possibly solved with a very extensive word lists.
