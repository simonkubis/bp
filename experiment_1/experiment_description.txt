Experiment #1

1. Keyword-based extraction

Other patterns mentioned in the text often come with few keywords like:
"see also", "used with", "used after", "apply before", "related pattern", "requires", "composed of", "alternative to"

We could possibly divide these words into a few groups such as:
"never use", "before", "after", "always together", "order does no matter"
or even into percentage based categories:
10%, 20%, ..., 90%, 100%
based on the keyword meaning:
never use: 0%
could use: 50%
always use: 100%
this text representation coeficient to use the pattern could be multiplicated by times mentioned in the text

Advantages of this method:
Quite simple to implement
Probably would work good on well written texts


Possible problems:

#1
This idea does not take context into account, pattern could be mentioned in one sentence and strongly advised not
to be used in the next one. We might approach this issue by checking whether the pattern is mentioned in the sentence before and after.

#2
This idea also lacks understanding the text when synonyms are used.
